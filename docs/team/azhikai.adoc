== PROJECT: MeNUS

---

== Overview

*MeNUS* is a restaurant management desktop application targeting restaurant owners in the National University
of Singapore (NUS). It is built to help them better manage their restaurants, especially if they are using complex,
expensive and independent systems. +

Restaurant owners interact with *MeNUS* using a Command Line Interface
(CLI). *MeNUS* also has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/[JavaFX] and it
is written using https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[Java 9] with
approximately 30 KLOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *user management* feature
** *What it does*: Allows the restaurant owner to create account for each of his employee to manage the system.
** *Justification*: This feature introduce the security layer to the application by ensuring that only
authorised personnel are able to execute certain sets of commands depending on their level of privilege.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands such that certain commands require the user to be
authenticated, otherwise it will not be executed. It required an in-depth analysis and understanding of the `Logic`,
`Model` and `Storage` components. The implementation too was challenging as it required modifications to existing
commands.
** *Credits*: Account password is hashed using https://github.com/patrickfav/bcrypt[`bcrypt`].

* *Minor enhancement*: Added side navigation bar to access the different components of the application.
